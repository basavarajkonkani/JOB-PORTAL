# Navbar & Footer Redesign Complete ✨

## Overview
Successfully redesigned the navbar and footer to match the full website design with glassmorphic effects, proper theming, and optimized CSS.

### Glassmorphic Design
- **Enhanced transparency**: Changed from `bg-white/95` to `bg-white/80` for better glassmorphic effect
- **Improved backdrop blur**: Using `backdrop-blur-xl` for stronger blur effect
- **Dynamic scroll effect**: Navbar becomes more opaque (`bg-white/90`) and adds stronger shadow when scrolled
- **Subtle border**: Changed to `border-blue-100/50` matching the site's blue theme

### Visual Consistency
